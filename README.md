# This a copy of [my cyber-dojo exercise](https://cyber-dojo.org/kata/edit/2pNnrF):
- Exercise: `12 Days of Xmas`
- Language & test-framework: `Java 21, Cucumber 7.20.1 with JUnit 4`

This is my first time using Cucumber and Java together. Also relatively new to Java, which thankfully is very similar to C#.
